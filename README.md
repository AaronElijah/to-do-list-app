# to-do-list-app

Note: This app was created as a 24 hour test challenge and as you would expect, it is not a polished product. However it does demostrate what I can do in short space of time, using the Realm mobile database module.

To use the app is simple.

On the inital view: -

1. Add button takes you to the other view where you can add new tasks, with a title, priority and date - the date is always kept to the current date
2. Date sort takes the tasks there and sorts them according to date - with the oldest being at the top of the table
3. Priority sort takes the tasks there and sorts them according to their priority - with most important at the top of the table
4. The text field and seach button together are used to search for tasks with a certain title. Click the "return" button the keyboard to dismiss the keyboard when you are finished typing.
5. Swiping left on one of the cells in the table will allow you to delete those individual tasks when you have completed them.
6. Tapping on one of the cells allows you to edit them by taking you to the other view where you can edit priority and title (but not the date).
